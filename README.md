# TroveDLC
New:
1. Skip: Allows you to teleport to a specified number of blocks in the direction of the camera.
2. Fly: Sets the acceleration vector with the specified value in the direction of the camera.
3. Added anti-afk to all connected windows.
4. Changed the interface (some say it's "toxic" )


Update:
1. Now the cheat does not work in an inactive window.
2. Now the cheat does not work when the chat is enabled.
It is necessary so that the cheat does not work with an open chat (you can not open it, but it will work with an open chat).
If only to start updating addresses with an open chat. Below (in the Update address:) it will be written.


Update addreses:
After the launch, if you don't see the nicknames, you need to update the addresses.
To do this, enter /debugtext and enter the first coordinate from location in the Position X and click UPDATE ADDRESS with the CHAT OPEN.
Next (up to 40 seconds, the addresses will be updated). You need to wait and do not touch anything until the nicknames appear.
It is better to do this only with one account running.
Sometimes it may be necessary to restart the cheat (if it freezes for more than 1 minute).


Hotkey —Åhanges:
If you click on the hotkey, and then on any key, then hotkey will change to it (you can't set one key to 2 functions).


It also creates a settings.ini file, so I advise you to keep the cheat in a separate folder.
Addresses can also be updated manually if you change them in settings.ini by opening it with notepad.
Antiviruses can swear because the keys are being captured (for hotkey) and the game memory is being read.
It is also recommended to run the program as an administrator.
Run the cheat first, and then the accounts. Sometimes anti-afk crashes accounts if they have already been launched.

P.S. I wanted the cheat not to work on the Marketplace as well, but there is no way to make an auto-update to its addresses.
I used a translator, so if something is unclear, write below.
